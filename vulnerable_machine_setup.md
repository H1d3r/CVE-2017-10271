# Vulnerable Oracle WebLogic 10.3.6.0.0

## Starting the Server
To download and start the vulnerable container, the following commands were used:

```
docker run -d -p7001:7001 kkirsche/cve-2017-10271:10.3.6.0.0
```

This will start an Ubuntu 14.04 server running Oracle WebLogic 10.3.6.0.0. Python is installed so that you may use it for reverse shell verification(s). 

## Additional notes
You may also, instead of using the pre-built form, use the Dockerfile located in the `./docker` directory
