# Vulnerable Oracle WebLogic 10.3.6.0.0

## Starting the Server
To download and start the container, the following commands were used:

```
docker run -d -p7001:7001 zhiqzhao/ubuntu_weblogic1036_domain
```

This starts the container and returns a SHA hash representing the container. Identify the human-friendly name using the following command:

```
docker ps
```

We will assume the name is `trusting_raman`.

## Server Modifications
As Docker images are stripped down and do not include the same software as a normal machine, we will make a modification to the container, installing Python 2 to mirror what would be found in a normal Ubuntu machine. Enter the container and installed this software using the following commands, confirming the installation when prompted:

```
docker exec -it trusting_raman /bin/bash
apt-get update
apt-get install python
```

At this point, changes to the host firewall may be necessary to expose port 7001 to the outside world
